    The security aspect im going to focus on is a man in the middle attack. The way this attack works is a third party
can act as the server and the client, and receive both sides of the contents. They can then modify and/or add malware,
which is eventually sent to its proper destination. Te defend against this, both parties share a master key with each
other and derive 2 keys and 2 hashes that will be used in future exchanges. When a message is sent, it is accompanied
by a hash value, which is only obtained through a key. So when the message is exchanged, if the contents are modified,
the receiving side will be able to check against the attached hash value and compare it to the value that they got. If
the values are different, there has been an attack, if not, then this is the message the sender expected.
